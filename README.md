# TIC-TACK-TOE
Sure, I'd be happy to explain how to play Tic Tac Toe! Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game that is played on a 3x3 grid. 
The players take turns marking spaces on the grid, typically with X's and O's, until one player gets three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until all nine spaces on the grid are filled and the game ends in a tie.
